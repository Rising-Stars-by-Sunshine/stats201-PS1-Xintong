Title,Abstract
Assistive technology in elderly care,"New developments in assistive technology are likely to make an important contribution to the care of elderly people in institutions and at home. Video‐monitoring, remote health monitoring, electronic sensors and equipment such as fall detectors, door monitors, bed alerts, pressure mats and smoke and heat alarms can improve older people's safety, security and ability to cope at home. Care at home is often preferable to patients and is usually less expensive for care providers than institutional alternatives."
Recent Trends in assistive technology for mobility,"Loss of physical mobility makes maximal participation in desired activities more difficult and in the worst case fully prevents participation. This paper surveys recent work in assistive technology to improve mobility for persons with a disability, drawing on examples observed during a tour of academic and industrial research sites in Europe. The underlying theme of this recent work is a more seamless integration of the capabilities of the user and the assistive technology. This improved integration spans diverse technologies, including powered wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, functional electrical stimulation, and wearable exoskeletons. Improved integration is being accomplished in three ways: 1) improving the assistive technology mechanics; 2) improving the user-technology physical interface; and 3) sharing of control between the user and the technology. We provide an overview of these improvements in user-technology integration and discuss whether such improvements have the potential to be transformative for people with mobility impairments."
"The right to assistive technology: for whom, for what, and by whom?","Despite its facilitating role in creating opportunities for people with disabilities to exercise human rights, access to assistive technology is limited in many countries. It is therefore promising that the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) addresses this area. The purpose of this study was to analyse the assistive technology content of the CRPD from a basic human rights perspective in order to clarify its limitations and opportunities for formulation of policies and implementation strategies. Data were collected through a content analysis of the CRPD. It is concluded that a non‐discriminatory interpretation of the provisions entitles all people with disabilities to a right to demand available and affordable assistive technology. Ensuring this right is a national as well as an international responsibility."
Outcomes of assistive technology use on quality of life,"The results from many research efforts on the use of assistive devices are reviewed and summarized. Further, conceptual and methodological issues related to the use and abandonment of assistive technologies are discussed. Overall, this review should be helpful to professionals making device recommendations, documenting the need for a device, and assessing short- and long-term device utilization. The available literature lends support to a model of matching person and technology that considers environments of device use, characteristics of the user's preferences and expectations, and device features and functions. To ensure that assistive technologies enhance users' quality of life, future emphases should focus on consumer involvement in the selection and evaluation of appropriate assistive technology, and ways to make technologies more widely available and affordable."
In the shadow of misperception: assistive technology use and social interactions,"Few research studies focus on how the use of assistive technologies is affected by social interaction among people. We present an interview study of 20 individuals to determine how assistive technology use is affected by social and professional contexts and interactions. We found that specific assistive devices sometimes marked their users as having disabilities; that functional access took priority over feeling self-conscious when using assistive technologies; and that two misperceptions pervaded assistive technology use: (1) that assistive devices could functionally eliminate a disability, and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream technologies. When this is not feasible, assistive devices should incorporate cutting edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design approach we propose here."
Disability studies as a source of critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology,"Disability studies and assistive technology are two related fields that have long shared common goals - understanding the experience of disability and identifying and addressing relevant issues. Despite these common goals, there are some important differences in what professionals in these fields consider problems, perhaps related to the lack of connection between the fields. To help bridge this gap, we review some of the key literature in disability studies. We present case studies of two research projects in assistive technology and discuss how the field of disability studies influenced that work, led us to identify new or different problems relevant to the field of assistive technology, and helped us to think in new ways about the research process and its impact on the experiences of individuals who live with disability. We also discuss how the field of disability studies has influenced our teaching and highlight some of the key publications and publication venues from which our community may want to draw more deeply in the future."
Desperately seeking simplicity: how young adults with cognitive disabilities and their families adopt assistive technologies,"A surprisingly high percentage of assistive technology devices (35% or more) are purchased, but not successfully adopted. Through semi-structured interviews with a dozen families, we have come to understand the role technology plays in the lives of families who have a young adult with cognitive disabilities, and how families find, acquire, and use these technologies. This study addresses gaps in existing research and informs future efforts in assistive technology design. Design implications include the importance of simplicity not only in technology function but in configuration, documentation, maintenance, and upgrade or replacement; as well as the need for designers to use methods that consider the multiple individuals and stages involved in the technology adoption process."
A Framework for the Adoption of Assistive Technology,"This paper proposes a framework for facilitating  the successful adoption of assistive technology  tools used by people with disabilities. It  identifies the participants in the adoption  process: the users, those involved with the user  on a daily bases (caregivers), designers and  assistive technology specialists. Each of these  parties must bring certain attributes to the  process in order for adoption to occur. Together,  a complex and often difficult collaborative  process of designing, selecting, personalizing,  learning and integrating must be accomplished."
Assistive Technology for Individuals with Disabilities: A Review and Synthesis of the Literature,"Despite the emphasis on technology and the rapid proliferation of assistive technology devices, little is known about the specific uses of assistive technology with persons who vary in disability type, severity, and age. The present study conducted a comprehensive review and a systematic analysis of published reports of assistive technology and skill acquisition of persons with disabilities. Uses of assistive technology, its benefits and obstacles, are reviewed. The results provide indications why technology is often abandoned. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed."
Interdependence as a Frame for Assistive Technology Research and Design,"In this paper, we describe interdependence for assistive technology design, a frame developed to complement the traditional focus on independence in the Assistive Technology field. Interdependence emphasizes collaborative access and people with disabilities' important and often understated contribution in these efforts. We lay the foundation of this frame with literature from the academic discipline of Disability Studies and popular media contributed by contemporary disability justice activists. Then, drawing on cases from our own work, we show how the interdependence frame (1) synthesizes findings from a growing body of research in the Assistive Technology field and (2) helps us orient to additional technology design opportunities. We position interdependence as one possible orientation to, not a prescription for, research and design practice--one that opens new design possibilities and affirms our commitment to equal access for people with disabilities."
A Survey of Assistive Technology Applications in Schools and Recommendations for Practice,"The Analysis of Technology Assistance for Children (ATAC) project was undertaken in recognition of the severe limit in information on current practices in field applications of assistive technology. Specifically, the ATAC project focused on investigating three problem areas: (1) the status of assistive technology in educational and related settings with school-age children with disabilities; (2) the benefits and barriers associated with using assistive technology for these youngsters; and (3) the effects of assistive technology use. A major aspect of the project involved a general survey of assistive technology use in special education classrooms across three states: Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This article presents the results of this effort, and discusses the implications in regard to improving practices in the field."
Assistive Technology Applications in Educational Programs of Children with Multiple Disabilities: A Case Study Report on the State of the Practice,"Results are reported of a two-year case study that analyzed how assistive technology was used in educational programs for 14 children with multiple disabilities who had two to ten years experience with assistive technology. The authors employed a modified longitudinal approach to study assistive technology use, the effects of technology applications, and barriers to the achievement of the children's educational goals. Data collection procedures included direct observation, videotapes of children as they used assistive technologies, questionnaires, and interviews with teachers and parents. In spite of a number of barriers, by the end of the study the children were able to use technology tools to accomplish tasks previously not possible due to the severity of their disabilities. The greatest improvement occurred in the areas of social and emotional development. The implications for assistive technology use by children with multiple disabilities are discussed."
The acceptability of assistive technology to older people,"Assistive technology (AT) is defined in this paper as ‘any device or system that allows an individual to perform a task that they would otherwise be unable to do, or increases the ease and safety with which the task can be performed’ (Cowan and Turner-Smith 1999). Its importance in contributing to older people's independence and autonomy is increasingly recognised, but there has been little research into the viability of extensive installations of AT. This paper focuses on the acceptability of AT to older people, and reports one component of a multi-disciplinary research project that examined the feasibility, acceptability, costs and outcomes of introducing AT into their homes. Sixty-seven people aged 70 or more years were interviewed in-depth during 2001 to find out about their use and experience of a wide range of assistive technologies. The findings suggest a complex model of acceptability, in which a ‘felt need’ for assistance combines with ‘product quality’. The paper concludes by considering the tensions that may arise in the delivery of acceptable assistive technology."
Computer vision for assistive technologies,"In the last decades there has been a tremendous increase in demand for Assistive Technologies (AT) useful to overcome functional limitations of individuals and to improve their quality of life. As a consequence, different research papers addressing the development of assistive technologies have appeared into the literature pushing the need to organize and categorize them taking into account the application assistive aims. Several surveys address the categorization problem for works concerning a specific need, hence giving the overview on the state of the art technologies supporting the related function for the individual. Unfortunately, this “user-need oriented” way of categorization considers each technology as a whole and then a deep and critical explanation of the technical knowledge used to build the operative tasks as well as a discussion on their cross-contextual applicability is completely missing making thus existing surveys unlikely to be technically inspiring for functional improvements and to explore new technological frontiers. To overcome this critical drawback, in this paper an original “task oriented” way to categorize the state of the art of the AT works has been introduced: it relies on the split of the final assistive goals into tasks that are then used as pointers to the works in literature in which each of them has been used as a component. In particular this paper concentrates on a set of cross-application Computer Vision tasks that are set as the pivots to establish a categorization of the AT already used to assist some of the user’s needs. For each task the paper analyzes the Computer Vision algorithms recently involved in the development of AT and, finally, it tries to catch a glimpse of the possible paths in the short and medium term that could allow a real improvement of the assistive outcomes. The potential impact on the assessment of AT considering users, medical, economical and social perspective is also addressed."
"Surveying Wearable Human Assistive Technology for Life and Safety Critical Applications: Standards, Challenges and Opportunities","In this survey a new application paradigm life and safety for critical operations and missions using wearable Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) technology is introduced. This paradigm has a vast scope of applications, including disaster management, worker safety in harsh environments such as roadside and building workers, mobile health monitoring, ambient assisted living and many more. It is often the case that during the critical operations and the target conditions, the existing infrastructure is either absent, damaged or overcrowded. In this context, it is envisioned that WBANs will enable the quick deployment of ad-hoc/on-the-fly communication networks to help save many lives and ensuring people's safety. However, to understand the applications more deeply and their specific characteristics and requirements, this survey presents a comprehensive study on the applications scenarios, their context and specific requirements. It explores details of the key enabling standards, existing state-of-the-art research studies, and projects to understand their limitations before realizing aforementioned applications. Application-specific challenges and issues are discussed comprehensively from various perspectives and future research and development directions are highlighted as an inspiration for new innovative solutions. To conclude, this survey opens up a good opportunity for companies and research centers to investigate old but still new problems, in the realm of wearable technologies, which are increasingly evolving and getting more and more attention recently."
"Non-use of provided assistive technology devices, a literature overview","Over the years, several studies have been performed on the subject of non-use of provided assistive technology. All of them report high rates of non-use. In this literature overview the determinants mentioned in literature that affect the degree of non-use will be discussed. They will be compared to the determinants that affect adherence with medical interventions. First, the various definitions of non-use used in literature will be compared. Next, an overview of the determinants of non-use of assistive technology will be given, categorized under personal factors, factors related to the assistive device, factors related to the user's environment and factors related to the intervention. After comparing these factors to the factors found in literature related to adherence with medical interventions, the strategies used to reduce non-adherence with medical interventions will be “translated” into the field of assistive technology provision."
