Title,Abstract
Assistive technology in elderly care,"New developments in assistive technology are likely to make an important contribution to the care of elderly people in institutions and at home. Video‐monitoring, remote health monitoring, electronic sensors and equipment such as fall detectors, door monitors, bed alerts, pressure mats and smoke and heat alarms can improve older people's safety, security and ability to cope at home. Care at home is often preferable to patients and is usually less expensive for care providers than institutional alternatives."
Recent Trends in assistive technology for mobility,"Loss of physical mobility makes maximal participation in desired activities more difficult and in the worst case fully prevents participation. This paper surveys recent work in assistive technology to improve mobility for persons with a disability, drawing on examples observed during a tour of academic and industrial research sites in Europe. The underlying theme of this recent work is a more seamless integration of the capabilities of the user and the assistive technology. This improved integration spans diverse technologies, including powered wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, functional electrical stimulation, and wearable exoskeletons. Improved integration is being accomplished in three ways: 1) improving the assistive technology mechanics; 2) improving the user-technology physical interface; and 3) sharing of control between the user and the technology. We provide an overview of these improvements in user-technology integration and discuss whether such improvements have the potential to be transformative for people with mobility impairments."
"The right to assistive technology: for whom, for what, and by whom?","Despite its facilitating role in creating opportunities for people with disabilities to exercise human rights, access to assistive technology is limited in many countries. It is therefore promising that the Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) addresses this area. The purpose of this study was to analyse the assistive technology content of the CRPD from a basic human rights perspective in order to clarify its limitations and opportunities for formulation of policies and implementation strategies. Data were collected through a content analysis of the CRPD. It is concluded that a non‐discriminatory interpretation of the provisions entitles all people with disabilities to a right to demand available and affordable assistive technology. Ensuring this right is a national as well as an international responsibility."
Outcomes of assistive technology use on quality of life,"The results from many research efforts on the use of assistive devices are reviewed and summarized. Further, conceptual and methodological issues related to the use and abandonment of assistive technologies are discussed. Overall, this review should be helpful to professionals making device recommendations, documenting the need for a device, and assessing short- and long-term device utilization. The available literature lends support to a model of matching person and technology that considers environments of device use, characteristics of the user's preferences and expectations, and device features and functions. To ensure that assistive technologies enhance users' quality of life, future emphases should focus on consumer involvement in the selection and evaluation of appropriate assistive technology, and ways to make technologies more widely available and affordable."
In the shadow of misperception: assistive technology use and social interactions,"Few research studies focus on how the use of assistive technologies is affected by social interaction among people. We present an interview study of 20 individuals to determine how assistive technology use is affected by social and professional contexts and interactions. We found that specific assistive devices sometimes marked their users as having disabilities; that functional access took priority over feeling self-conscious when using assistive technologies; and that two misperceptions pervaded assistive technology use: (1) that assistive devices could functionally eliminate a disability, and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream technologies. When this is not feasible, assistive devices should incorporate cutting edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design approach we propose here."
Disability studies as a source of critical inquiry for the field of assistive technology,"Disability studies and assistive technology are two related fields that have long shared common goals - understanding the experience of disability and identifying and addressing relevant issues. Despite these common goals, there are some important differences in what professionals in these fields consider problems, perhaps related to the lack of connection between the fields. To help bridge this gap, we review some of the key literature in disability studies. We present case studies of two research projects in assistive technology and discuss how the field of disability studies influenced that work, led us to identify new or different problems relevant to the field of assistive technology, and helped us to think in new ways about the research process and its impact on the experiences of individuals who live with disability. We also discuss how the field of disability studies has influenced our teaching and highlight some of the key publications and publication venues from which our community may want to draw more deeply in the future."
Desperately seeking simplicity: how young adults with cognitive disabilities and their families adopt assistive technologies,"A surprisingly high percentage of assistive technology devices (35% or more) are purchased, but not successfully adopted. Through semi-structured interviews with a dozen families, we have come to understand the role technology plays in the lives of families who have a young adult with cognitive disabilities, and how families find, acquire, and use these technologies. This study addresses gaps in existing research and informs future efforts in assistive technology design. Design implications include the importance of simplicity not only in technology function but in configuration, documentation, maintenance, and upgrade or replacement; as well as the need for designers to use methods that consider the multiple individuals and stages involved in the technology adoption process."
A Framework for the Adoption of Assistive Technology,"This paper proposes a framework for facilitating  the successful adoption of assistive technology  tools used by people with disabilities. It  identifies the participants in the adoption  process: the users, those involved with the user  on a daily bases (caregivers), designers and  assistive technology specialists. Each of these  parties must bring certain attributes to the  process in order for adoption to occur. Together,  a complex and often difficult collaborative  process of designing, selecting, personalizing,  learning and integrating must be accomplished."
Assistive Technology for Individuals with Disabilities: A Review and Synthesis of the Literature,"Despite the emphasis on technology and the rapid proliferation of assistive technology devices, little is known about the specific uses of assistive technology with persons who vary in disability type, severity, and age. The present study conducted a comprehensive review and a systematic analysis of published reports of assistive technology and skill acquisition of persons with disabilities. Uses of assistive technology, its benefits and obstacles, are reviewed. The results provide indications why technology is often abandoned. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed."
Interdependence as a Frame for Assistive Technology Research and Design,"In this paper, we describe interdependence for assistive technology design, a frame developed to complement the traditional focus on independence in the Assistive Technology field. Interdependence emphasizes collaborative access and people with disabilities' important and often understated contribution in these efforts. We lay the foundation of this frame with literature from the academic discipline of Disability Studies and popular media contributed by contemporary disability justice activists. Then, drawing on cases from our own work, we show how the interdependence frame (1) synthesizes findings from a growing body of research in the Assistive Technology field and (2) helps us orient to additional technology design opportunities. We position interdependence as one possible orientation to, not a prescription for, research and design practice--one that opens new design possibilities and affirms our commitment to equal access for people with disabilities."
A Survey of Assistive Technology Applications in Schools and Recommendations for Practice,"The Analysis of Technology Assistance for Children (ATAC) project was undertaken in recognition of the severe limit in information on current practices in field applications of assistive technology. Specifically, the ATAC project focused on investigating three problem areas: (1) the status of assistive technology in educational and related settings with school-age children with disabilities; (2) the benefits and barriers associated with using assistive technology for these youngsters; and (3) the effects of assistive technology use. A major aspect of the project involved a general survey of assistive technology use in special education classrooms across three states: Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This article presents the results of this effort, and discusses the implications in regard to improving practices in the field."
